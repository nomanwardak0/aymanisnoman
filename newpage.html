            Here you are! I knew you would apologize (thanks for the wholehearted apology). <br><br>
            Over the past few days, you have proved the fact that you are a strong woman. I said I will prove my
            patience and your weakness but you proved me wrong. Staying 6 days like that is not easy. But I knew you
            could do it, and I am proud of you, as I always was and as I always will be. You have never failed to keep
            me happy and satisfied with who you are and how you are. I understood your annoyance very well and your
            frustration, and it’s totally fine to not call someone with good names in a situation like that, but I still
            know you didn’t mean any of that ;) <br><br>
            Ahh, you know it’s time for that moment again, the moment we both hate. I wish I never had to leave this
            state of utopia. After all, I can’t imagine Norid without you anymore. If I were told to choose between
            befriending all the strangers out there or befriending only you and no one else, I would choose you over all
            of them, and you deserve it, in fact at this point, I’m afraid I will never be able to pay back for what you
            have done for and to me. You always return because you know I can’t live without you. You have proved to be
            more caring than me because I don’t think I can wait for someone for 2 months when I have only met them for
            2 weeks and then keep sending them messages regularly, indeed you deserve more than I can ever give. If
            there’s one thing I’m glad I have, it’s you. Thank you for everything, for all the help, for all those times
            you waited but you never made me wait, for all those messages you sent despite knowing that I’m not there,
            for all the times you thought of me, when I wasn’t there, for all the love you have given. You are all I
            ever needed, and now that I have what I need, I won’t keep looking, because I know I won’t be able to find
            any better. <br><br>
            Leaving like this is unbearable for me, but the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that you are
            always waiting, like an angel who’s always there for me. And I promise, you will forever have Norid. You are
            the one who always fills the cracks, and keeps this friendship together by keeping a promise. How can I
            ignore the truth? I wish I could express my gratitude in words, the other day I was dreaming about being
            there in NYC but before I could reach you, I had already realized it was a dream lmao. Maybe one day I will
            come to NYC for real. <br><br>
            And don’t forget, these departures are nothing but reminders of how valuable this friendship is. And there’s
            always light at the end of the tunnel, and we will go through it together! <br><br>
            Don’t lose hope, I know you trust me and the fact that I will never leave you alone, then it doesn’t matter
            what it takes. And If I died, Allah will let you know. I know this is just another easy thing for a strong
            woman like you, indeed you are the strongest of all I have ever seen. <br><br>
            India was replaced with Iran (which I’m totally not happy about btw), though I have absolutely no idea how
            much time it will take, maybe its less than I expect or maybe its more, but I’m sure it will end ;) but
            things might probably not stay the same after that, I will explain everything once everything's done. I have
            a lot to say. <br><br>
            You keep being as strong as you always are, and I will be back in no time, make sure to keep praying and
            keep me in your praying , indeed your prayers are the reason for me being as happy as you want me to be,
            and of course I will do the same. And don’t get in a relationship, you are such an obeyful girl. if
            something bothers you at school or anywhere else, make sure to let the officials and your parents know, and
            if sometimes your mom scolds you for something your clumsy sister did, let it go ;¬) don’t forget to keep
            sending me messages anytime you feel like and anything you feel like telling, indeed I will read all of
            them. And keep practicing chess!<br><br>
            Again I’m proud of you, keep that strength forever and I will keep this proudness forever.<br><br>
            And of course, take care of yourself, your family and your friends, and I will see you soon
            Missunderstanding, I promise, and thank you in advance for what you are about to go through because of me,
            you are the best! And indeed you define luck for me ;)<br><br>
            Goodbye dear angel! <br><br>
